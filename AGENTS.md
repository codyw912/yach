## Rust Environment

- Use `just` recipes for routine project commands so humans and agents go through the same environment entry point.
- For ad hoc commands that still need the Rust dev shell, use `just dev <cmd...>`.
- If you need shell syntax like pipes, redirects, or `&&`, run it through `just dev-shell '<cmd>'`.
- Avoid running bare `cargo ...` unless you are already inside the project's devenv shell via `direnv`, `direnv exec`, or `nix develop`.
