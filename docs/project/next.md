## Recommended Next Move

Recommended next move: write a focused extension developer/package UX design
before implementing templates, TypeScript/Rust host packaging, git refs, or npm
adapter behavior.

Why: the first conservative extension runtime plan is implemented through
startup and activation profiling evidence, and local-path install records now
provide durable user/project package roots. The next meaningful product slice is
turning active extension hosts into a developer-friendly local loop. Background
metadata activation now gives enabled user extensions live, routable
registrations after first paint, and the runtime stop path is now controllable
from the TUI through the negotiated lifecycle protocol. Stop, reload, and live
status snapshots now give a basic developer loop without restarting yach. The
next risk is not another lifecycle command; it is deciding the user-facing shape
for authoring, packaging, installing, and iterating on extensions while
preserving Rust-native startup performance and supporting TypeScript/Rust hosts.
That package/developer UX needs an explicit design before implementation.

## Near-Term Alternative

### Provider Tool Guardrails

Add provider-loop guardrails that reduce model-authored claims of local effects
when tool evidence is missing.

Why: dogfooding showed the backend loop is correct, but older prompts let the
model claim an edit after only reading. This is less important than extension
runtime work because the stronger prompt and existing tool evidence path
produce correct behavior, but the provider-loop harness can still become more
defensive.

## Not Ready Without a New Spec

- Provider-advertised file mutation beyond the canonical exact/create edit
  schemas, extension-owned mutation tools, broad write/patch/delete/rename
  tools, or multi-operation edit atomicity.
- Process or shell execution tools.
- Network tools.
- Npm/git extension package adapters, developer templates,
  package-manager integration, or cross-language host packaging beyond the
  accepted manifest-first, metadata-first runtime/replacement design.
- A working auto-review reviewer/subagent runtime.
- Broad provider settings UI.
- Moving or deleting `docs/project-os/`.

Each of these needs a focused Superpowers design before implementation.
