## Recommended Next Move

Resume Native MVP implementation with read/search/context tools.

Recommended first slice: add native read-only project inspection through policy-governed project roots, path metadata, text reads, and search/context packaging before file edits.

Why: session resume and baseline native-session metrics are in place, so the next blocker for real dogfooding is safe project understanding before mutation.

Relevant sources:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-native-mvp-definition-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-10-native-session-store-resume-metrics.md`
- `docs/plans/2026-05-05-006-plan-first-non-fixture-native-tool.md`
- `docs/plans/2026-05-05-004-plan-provider-tool-result-continuation.md`
- `docs/plans/2026-05-05-005-plan-real-provider-continuation-adapter-mapping.md`

## Near-Term Alternative

### Performance evidence follow-up

Continue performance evidence only when it informs a Native MVP implementation choice.

Why: yach's thesis depends on measured responsiveness, but the next product move is read/search/context unless a performance question blocks it.

Relevant sources:

- `crates/yach-bench/benches/native_session.rs`
- `docs/benchmarks/current-baseline-2026-05-05.md`
- `docs/project-os/performance-evidence.md`

## Not Ready Without a New Spec

- Defaulting to the native backend.
- File mutation tools.
- Process or shell execution tools.
- Network tools.
- Broad provider settings UI.
- Moving or deleting `docs/project-os/`.

Each of these needs a focused Superpowers design before implementation.
