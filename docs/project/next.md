## Recommended Next Move

Recommended next move: write the implementation plan for the accepted
native-provider multi-round tool loop design, then implement it as the next
Native MVP slice.

Why: dogfooding the provider-visible read/search/edit surface showed the current
one-round continuation boundary is the blocker. The provider can read a file and
then need a later edit tool call, but yach currently requires the first
continuation to be final text. The accepted design replaces that fragile
boundary with a bounded backend-owned tool loop while preserving yach-owned
validation, permissions, review, evidence, and future extension replacement
semantics.

## Near-Term Alternative

### Extension Runtime And Tool Replacement

Design the extension runtime, install/package UX, and explicit built-in tool
replacement policy before implementing broader tool surfaces.

Why: the multi-round loop design intentionally preserves extension-owned tools
and replacement semantics at the registry contract level, but it does not design
host activation, package installation, TypeScript/Rust ergonomics, hot reload,
or provider-visible extension availability before a turn. Those should be
prioritized soon after the loop design/implementation path is underway.

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-18-native-provider-multi-round-tool-loop-design.md`

## Not Ready Without a New Spec

- Provider-advertised file mutation beyond the canonical exact/create edit
  schemas, extension-owned mutation tools, broad write/patch/delete/rename
  tools, or multi-operation edit atomicity.
- Process or shell execution tools.
- Network tools.
- Extension runtime implementation beyond safe metadata tool registration and manifest-only static context metadata.
- A working auto-review reviewer/subagent runtime.
- Broad provider settings UI.
- Moving or deleting `docs/project-os/`.

Each of these needs a focused Superpowers design before implementation.
