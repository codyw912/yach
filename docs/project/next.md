# Next Work

## Recommended Next Move

Recommended next move: write an implementation plan for the first conservative
extension runtime slice, then implement it in small branches.

Why: real-provider dogfooding confirmed the native-provider multi-round
read-then-edit path works when the model is instructed not to claim success
before tool evidence exists. The extension runtime/tool replacement design is
now accepted, and it identifies the next durable product path: make installed
extensions discoverable after first paint, preserve startup speed, and route a
safe metadata `toy_tool` through a persistent process-host protocol before
moving into richer tools.

## Near-Term Alternative

### Provider Tool Guardrails

Add provider-loop guardrails that reduce model-authored claims of local effects
when tool evidence is missing.

Why: dogfooding showed the backend loop is correct, but older prompts let the
model claim an edit after only reading. This is less important than extension
runtime work because the stronger prompt and existing tool evidence path
produce correct behavior, but the provider-loop harness can still become more
defensive.

## Not Ready Without a New Spec

- Provider-advertised file mutation beyond the canonical exact/create edit
  schemas, extension-owned mutation tools, broad write/patch/delete/rename
  tools, or multi-operation edit atomicity.
- Process or shell execution tools.
- Network tools.
- Extension runtime behavior beyond the accepted manifest-first,
  process-hosted, metadata-first runtime/replacement design.
- A working auto-review reviewer/subagent runtime.
- Broad provider settings UI.
- Moving or deleting `docs/project-os/`.

Each of these needs a focused Superpowers design before implementation.
