## Recommended Next Move

Recommended next move: execute the production edit tracing implementation plan
subagent-driven.

Why: the accepted tracing design now has a concrete implementation plan. This
should land before broader mutation or read/search content tools expand the
surface, so provider-originated edit validation, review, apply/reject, and
continuation states have stable durable trace IDs and phase timings.

## Near-Term Alternative

### Provider-visible read/search content

Design provider-visible read/search content tools for agent edit usefulness.

Why: canonical exact/create edit tools assume the provider already has the
needed target text. Read/search content exposure remains the near-term
alternative if real edit usefulness is blocked more by context acquisition than
by tracing.

Relevant sources:

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-11-native-read-search-context.md`
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-native-readonly-tool-loop-design.md`

## Not Ready Without a New Spec

- Provider-advertised file mutation beyond the canonical exact/create edit
  schemas, extension-owned mutation tools, broad write/patch/delete/rename
  tools, or multi-operation edit atomicity.
- Process or shell execution tools.
- Network tools.
- Extension runtime implementation beyond safe metadata tool registration and manifest-only static context metadata.
- A working auto-review reviewer/subagent runtime.
- Broad provider settings UI.
- Moving or deleting `docs/project-os/`.

Each of these needs a focused Superpowers design before implementation.
