# Next Work

## Recommended Next Move

Recommended next move: execute the native edit transactions preview implementation plan.

Why: the accepted design recommends a transaction-engine-first path before provider-visible mutation. The next Native MVP gap is the preview-only backend primitive: `NativeEditEngine::preview`, one operation per transaction, `modify_text_file` and `create_text_file`, exact-match hunks, project-root path policy, yach-owned edit IDs, hash guards, no-overwrite create planning, bounded diff summaries, and focused tests. Runtime apply, session evidence, hidden/local tool harnessing, and benchmarks should follow as later slices after preview semantics are stable.

## Near-Term Alternative

### Performance evidence follow-up

Continue performance evidence only when it informs a Native MVP implementation choice.

Why: yach's thesis depends on measured responsiveness, but performance work should now stay tied to concrete Native MVP decisions such as edit transactions, startup activation boundaries, or provider/tool-loop latency.

Relevant sources:

- `crates/yach-bench/benches/native_session.rs`
- `docs/benchmarks/current-baseline-2026-05-05.md`
- `docs/project-os/performance-evidence.md`

## Not Ready Without a New Spec

- Defaulting to the native backend.
- Provider-advertised file mutation tools, extension-owned mutation tools, delete/rename, or multi-operation edit atomicity.
- Process or shell execution tools.
- Network tools.
- Extension runtime implementation beyond safe metadata tool registration and manifest-only static context metadata.
- Broad provider settings UI.
- Moving or deleting `docs/project-os/`.

Each of these needs a focused Superpowers design before implementation.
