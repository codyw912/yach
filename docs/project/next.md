## Recommended Next Move

Recommended next move: continue Native MVP implementation with explicit native-provider one-round integration for safe read-only tool results.

Why: yach can now execute safe read-only metadata tools locally and map their results into adapter-ready continuation input, but native-provider dogfooding still needs a guarded runtime loop that collects model tool calls, executes the local read-only tool loop, submits one continuation round, and records the final turn outcome.

## Near-Term Alternative

### Performance evidence follow-up

Continue performance evidence only when it informs a Native MVP implementation choice.

Why: yach's thesis depends on measured responsiveness, but the next product move is autonomous safe read-only tool integration unless a performance question blocks it.

Relevant sources:

- `crates/yach-bench/benches/native_session.rs`
- `docs/benchmarks/current-baseline-2026-05-05.md`
- `docs/project-os/performance-evidence.md`

## Not Ready Without a New Spec

- Defaulting to the native backend.
- File mutation tools.
- Process or shell execution tools.
- Network tools.
- Broad provider settings UI.
- Moving or deleting `docs/project-os/`.

Each of these needs a focused Superpowers design before implementation.
